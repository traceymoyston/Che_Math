    "In statistics and boostrapping, the truth is (typically) unknown and there is noise associated with any given measurement. So our question becomes “how confident am I that the parameters of my model are not zero?” And as discussed in class, all kinds of challenges arise when using bootstrapping. Here, we'll try a simple example.\n",
